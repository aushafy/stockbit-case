### Toolstack: Nginx (Service that running in a Container), Docker (Container), Docker Hub (Public Container Image Registry), AWS EC2 (to running container on deployment step), Github Actions (CICD Pipeline).

#### Github Actions YAML File directory: .github/workflows/docker-image.yml

P.S. I choose Github Actions because I don't have any resource to run Gitlab Runner. However, I used Gitlab, Jenkins, and GCP Cloud Build in my current company.
